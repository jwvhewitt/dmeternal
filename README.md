ABOUT
=====

DME is a party-based fantasy roguelike roleplaying game. You control a group of
up to four adventurers, who set off on a randomly determined quest in a randomly
constructed world.

INSTALLATION
============

This game requires Pygame and Python 2.6 or 2.7 to be installed on your system.
Do that first.

  https://www.python.org/

  http://www.pygame.org/

Unzip the game files and put them in a convenient folder. The file you want
to run is "game.py"; with any luck you will just be able to double click that
file and the game will start. If not, try right clicking and select "open
with Python".

The first time it's run, the game will create a "dmeternal" folder in your
home directory (or in "~/.config" on Linux) and place a configuration file
there. This is where all of your characters and saved games are stored, in
case you want to delete them or make backups. The configuration file can be
edited in any text editor.

In fact, the entire game can be edited in any text editor. Go ahead and look at
how things work. Try adding your own items, monsters, spells, and whatnot.

HOW TO PLAY
===========

Run game.py.

Create four characters. You could do worse than starting with a warrior, thief,
priest, and mage.

Start a campaign. After the game world is constructed, you will be asked to
choose four characters and enter a name for the save file.

Explore the world. Beat up monsters and take their stuff.
